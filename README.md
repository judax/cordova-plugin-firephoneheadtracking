cordova-plugin-firephoneheadtracking
====================================

A Cordova plugin to handle Amazon's FirePhone Head Tracking using their exact same WebApp JavaScript API. You can use this plugin if you want to generate a standard Amazon Android App and still use the Head Tracking native API from JavaScript. As The API is the same as the one Amazon exposes in the WebApp environment, your App/Code will be compatible if for some reason you want to develop an Amazon WebApp in the future/too.
